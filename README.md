# Deep Learning Udacity Nanodegree - SageMaker Deployment Project


This is the final solution of the project 'Sagemaker Deployment' which consists in deploying a Sentiment Analysis model using RNN in the Amazon AWS SageMaker tool. The notebook and Python files provided here result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews.

In the final architecture AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions is used as well. The application architecture diagram is:

You can find the original code without solutions in the original [Udacity SageMaker Deployment repository](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment).

 This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the IMDB Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost mini-project (which can be found in the original repository) should provide enough background.
